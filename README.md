# HR-Attrition
# we have data of survey of employees and managers from that we just try to get attrition trend or reason and on the basis of trend we will predict the attrition of employees and try to stop attrition
# firstly we just try to manipulate data and calculate the fields that are important for reason of attriton. here we calculate the average timing using the in time and out time data 
# we make data clean and treating the outliers 
# make some visualization so that we have some reasons of attrition or some trends
# preparing the data for model building 
# building the models and checking the accuracies of all models
# do some hyperparameter so we have best set of parameter and high accuracy for model
